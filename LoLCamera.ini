[Camera Settings]

lerp_rate = 0.0015					; This controls smoothing, smaller values mean slower camera movement
threshold = 0.1						; Minimum threshold before calculations halted because camera is "close enough"

mouse_range_max = 2300.0			; controls the range at which these factors start falling off
dest_range_max = 2300.0				;

[Camera Frequencies]
poll_data = 5						; Frequency of the data polling from the client. 1 is the fastest. Modifying this value is not recommanded.
sleep_time = 1						; Time slept between two camera updates (in ms). 1 is the fastest. Modifying this value is not recommanded.
