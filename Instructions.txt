About the weights in LoLCamera.ini :
====================================

If you increase the value of a weight, the camera will try to put the center of the screen at the location of this weight.
If you set 2 weights = 1.0, let's say A = 1.0 and B = 1.0, all others weights = 0.0, the camera will be at the middle between A and B.
For instance, champ_weight : If you increase this value, the camera will try to center the camera on the champion.

    - mouse_weight : focus the current position of the mouse
    - dest_weight : focus the destination of your champion (when you right click on the ground)
    - lmb_weight : focus where you left clicked (when clicked on the ground) - disabled by default because it is confusing when you don't know how to use it
    - focus_weight : focus the champion you left clicked
    - hint_weight : focus the champion you hovered with your mouse
    - global_weight_allies : focus the allies around the champion (it will try to center to the median of the position of all allies around the champion)
    - global_weight_ennemies : the same but for ennemies
